# odin-recipes
The objective of this project is for me to practice all the HTML knowledge I have acquired.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

Skills i'll have to demonstrate:
- HTML boilerplate;
- text elements;
- lists;
- links and images;
- git commands;
- commit messages;
