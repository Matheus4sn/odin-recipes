    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>8 chicken thighs with skin and bone</li>
        <li>200 g of okra (about 20 units)</li>
        <li>1 yellow pepper</li>
        <li>1 ripe Italian tomato</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>broth of 2 lemons</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>
        <li>2½ cups (tea) of water</li>
        <li>olive oil to taste</li>
        <li>freshly salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, season the thighs and thighs with cumin, paprika, 2 teaspoons of salt, black pepper to taste and the broth of 1 lemon. Spread the seasonings well with your hands to cover the entire surface of the chicken and leave to marinate for 15 minutes at room temperature – in addition to absorbing the flavors, the chicken loses its ice before going into the pan. Meanwhile, prepare the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Wash, dry and cut the pepper and tomato in half, lengthwise. Discard the seeds and cut the pepper into 1 cm cubes and the tomato into 0.5 cm cubes.</li>
        <li>Place a large casserole dish (or large saucepan) over medium heat to heat. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and place the chicken thighs and thighs, skin side down, next to each other without crowding them – this prevents the pieces from cooking in the steam. Brown for 4 minutes on each side and transfer the chicken to a platter. Attention: do not discard the chicken marinade liquid, it will be used in the broth.</li>
        <li>Keep the pan over medium heat (you don't need to add olive oil as the chicken releases its own fat). Add the onion, tomato and season with a pinch of salt. Sauté for about 2 minutes, pressing with a spatula to form a paste. Add the pepper and sauté for another 2 minutes, until wilted. Add the garlic and stir for 1 minute to perfume.</li>
        <li>Water the pan little by little with water, scraping the bottom with a spatula to dissolve any burnt spots — they add flavor to the preparation. Add the marinade liquid, season with ½ teaspoon of salt, and cook until it boils.</li>
        <li>As soon as it boils, return the thighs and thighs to the pan, skin side up – in this type of preparation called braising, the cooking liquid should not completely cover the chicken, the pieces will cook and remain moist, but the skin will remain Golden. Cook for 25 minutes with the lid ajar, over medium heat, until the chicken is tender. Meanwhile, prepare the okra.</li>
        <li>Wash and dry the okra well with a clean kitchen towel. Discard the stem and cut each one into 3 pieces, diagonally. Transfer to a bowl and pour over the broth from 1 lemon – in addition to flavor, the lemon broth prevents the okra from releasing too much sap.</li>
        <li>After 25 minutes, open the pan and add the okra, between the chicken pieces. Cook for another 5 minutes without the lid, until the okra is slightly soft and the broth is thick. Serve immediately, it is delicious with creamy canjiquinha with lemon and crispy roasted okra.</li>
